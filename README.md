Do not pull the gh-page branch. This branch contains what is hosted on the link. The source code is in the main branch.

If you want to update the webpage, run 'npm run deploy' from within the currency-exchange folder on the main branch. If you want it to have a custom commit message, use 'npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"'
